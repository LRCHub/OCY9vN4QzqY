I don't care 'bout your money, or your fancy cars
Some people call me bunny
I can switch you like a tsar
Sweet like honey, sticking like gum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
Chew you like a cannibal, red, redrum
If you be diablo, then I'll leave you hollow
Where I go, you follow
So you better act right
My love is bittersweet
But I can show you heaven
But first get on your knees
Close your eyes and count to seven
I don't care if you're a peasant or a king
If you're with me then you're everything
You tease me for all the drama
Can fix my heart with all your comments
You drive so fast, don't care about my mama
As if we're gonna make it
And I'm too good for all your bullshit
But you got something that I don't quit
So let's pretend like we're too perfect
As if we're gonna make it
(As if we're gonna make it)
(As if we're gonna make it)
You tease me for all the drama
Can fix my heart with all your comments
You drive so fast, don't care about my mama
As if we're gonna make it
And I'm too good for all your bullshit
But you got something that I don't quit
So let's pretend like we're too perfect
As if we're gonna make it
As if we're gonna make it
As if we're gonna make it
