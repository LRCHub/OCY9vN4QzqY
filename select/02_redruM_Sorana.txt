Done done done, done done do-done
Done done done, done done
Emergency room, they said bruises on the heart
What can I do, I tried everything so far
I called 911 from a telephone booth
I said, "Help her, she's dying from hearing the truth"
I made her suffer, have you read the news
That she had a lover and I love him too
What goes around comes back around
Sorry that he chose me now
What goes around comes back around
Can't you hear, she's crying out
Redrum, redrum
Look what I did, look what I've done, done
Redrum, redrum
I took his heart, is that so wrong?
She's done done done, done done do-done
Done done done, done done do-done
She's done done done, done done do-done
Crying redrum, redrum
Blood on the street, rumors spreadin' really fast
They talk about me, like I've done something so bad
I called 911 from a telephone booth
I said, "Help her, she's dying from hearing the truth"
Stop all the talking now, stop all the news
They love to judge me, ain't got any proof
What goes around comes back around
Sorry that he chose me now
What goes around comes back around
Can't you hear, she's crying out
Redrum, redrum
Look what I did, look what I've done, done
Redrum, redrum
I took his heart, is that so wrong?
She's done done done, done done do-done
Done done done, done done do-done
She's done done done, done done do-done
Crying redrum, redrum
(Redrum, redrum)
(Redrum, redrum)
(Redrum, redrum)
Redrum, redrum
Look what I did, look what I've done, done
Redrum, redrum
I took his heart, is that so wrong?
She's done done done, done done do-done
I took her lover and now that he's gone
She's done done done, done done do-done
Crying redrum, redrum
Redrum, redrum
(Redrum, redrum)
(Redrum, redrum)
Redrum, redrum
